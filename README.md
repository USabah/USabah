Hello, my name is Uriya Sabah. I'm currently a Junior at Hofstra University majoring in computer science. I'm very interested in backend technologies and learning
about the logic behind the technology we use on a daily basis. I am currently taking data science, machine learning, and AI courses as I am planning on doing research for Northwell Health in the Summer of 2022 using ML. I'm currently looking to gain more experience developing real-world projects which
are useful and accessible to others.

Currently, the best place to reach me is my school email: USabah1@pride.hofstra.edu
I can also be reached through my LinkedIn account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/uriya-sabah-7287b7192/
