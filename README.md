Hello, my name is Uriya Sabah. I'm currently a sophomore at Hofstra University majoring in computer science. I've very interested in backend languages and learning
about the logic behind the functionality of technology we use on a daily basis. I'm currently looking to gain more experience developing real-world projects which
are useful and accessible to others.
I can be reached through my email: USabah1@pride.hofstra.edu
or through my LinkedIn account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/uriya-sabah-7287b7192/
